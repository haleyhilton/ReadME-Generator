  ## Description
  This project serves to create a quick and professional ReadME. By using node index.js the user is led through a series of prompts that they can be as detailed or vague as they wish in answering. Once they have entered the info, their answers are logged in a new ReadMe.md that they can further edit if they'd like. An example of when this would be applicable is if they'd like to include screenshots after the fact.
